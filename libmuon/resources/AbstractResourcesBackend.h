 * \class AbstractResourcesBackend  AbstractResourcesBackend.h "AbstractResourcesBackend.h"
 *
 * \brief This is the base class of all resource backends.
 * 
 * For writing basic new resource backends, we need to implement two classes: this and the 
 * AbstractResource one. Basic questions on how to build your plugin with those classes
 * can be answered by looking at the dummy plugin.
 * 
 * As this is the base class of a backend, we save all the created resources here and also
 * accept calls to install and remove applications or to cancel transactions.
 * 
 * To show resources in Muon, we need to initialize all resources we want to show beforehand,
 * we should not create resources in the search function. When we reload the resources
 * (e.g. when initializing), the backend needs change the fetching property throughout the
 * processs.
