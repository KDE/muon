1.2.1:
======
- Bugfixes:
  * Fixed a bug with the Muon Software Center where reviews would not load when
    visiting an application page you had already been to since you started MSC.
  * Fixed a bug in the Muon Package and Update Managers where the busy cursor
    would not go away if a mass package marking failed.
  * Fixed a crash in the Muon Update Manager when hitting the "Revert Changes"
    button in the toolbar.
  * Added the kdelibs5-data package to the Muon Software Center's blacklist.
    It has desktop files that show up as Apps, and we don't want people breaking
    their system by uninstalling them. (And thereby uninstalling kdelibs)
  * Only enable the purge action in MPM/MUM for uninstalled packages when the
    uninstalled packages also have residual configurtaion. (LP: #836967)
  * Set the xapain progress message visible even before it has gone from 0% to 1%
  * Fix a bug where installing a package from within the "More Details" view of
    the Muon Software Center would not do anything. (LP: #841323)
  * Use LibQApt's new multi-arch support to disambiguate between native and
    foreign-arch packages, fixing an apparent duplication of packages. (BKO: #276389,
    LP: #837389)

1.2.0:
======
- Features:
  * Added a checkmark emblem to installed applications in the Muon Software Center.
  * Added a history dialog to the Muon Package Manager using the HistoryView from
    libmuon. Accessible from the "View" menu or by the Ctrl + H shortcut.
  * Use more appropriate header strings in the Muon Update Manager.
  * Added a Zeitgeist-based app usage counter to the Muon Software Center.
  * Make changes requiring authorization turn the MPM config dialog's apply
    button's icon into the password icon, like System Settings modules that require
    admin access have on their apply button.
  * Added an option to the configuration dialog to make APT treat a package’s
    "Suggests" as dependencies. For those who don’t care about disk space.
  * Enabled selection of multiple packages at a time in the Muon Package Manager,
    as well as the option to mark multiple packages at once.
  * A package in the package view can now be de-selected, hiding the details widget,
    by ctrl-clicking on the package.
  * Add an option to the Muon Package Manager for controlling whether or not to allow
    the installation of untrusted packages altogether.
  * Add a "Locked" filter to the status filters in the Muon Package Manager.
  * Add support for downloading packages from a list, and adding these packages to the
    cache. (For internet-less computers)
  * Show non-application packages in the Muon Software Center's PPA views.
  * Add support to the Muon Software Center for displaying applications from
    extras.ubuntu.com, which extend the package control records to provide app
    information in leiu of .desktop files in app-install-data.
  * Use the Ubuntu ratings and reviews API for application ratings rather than relying
    on PopCon.
  * Add support to the Muon Software Center for displaying reviews from the Ubuntu
    Reviews and Ratings API using QJson.
  * Made the "Addons" and "Reviews" widgets hideable in the Muon Software Center.
  * Move the support string in to the package description. This wastes less space in
    general, and makes things more elegant for distributions that are not driven by
    Canonical in the first place. (libmuon)
  * Several layout improvements to the main details tab that reduces the amount of
    chrome, making more space for content. (libmuon)
  * Tighten up the spacing between the short description/button box and the long
    description text area. (libmuon)
  * Make the easter egg common to all frontends using libmuon (libmuon)
  * Use a KMessageWidget for application launch notification rather than a dialog.
    (The dialog is still used when multiple apps are installed at once) (MSC)
  * Status bar layout improvements that allow us to lose the frame around the labels
    in the statusbar. (libmuon)
  * Added some Debian branding love (Debian icon/main origin at the top of the list),
    like what we currently do for Kubuntu.

- Optimizations:
  * Speed up application menu path determination by using the KService entry for
    an application that is already cached in the KDE Sycoca database rather than creating
    a new KService object. (MSC)
  * Use a global MuonStrings instance throughout the Muon Suite so that each class that
    uses MuonStrings doesn't have to keep its own copy of the identical data. (All)
  * Take the '*''s off of our wildcard filter and use QString::contains rather than a
    QRegExp. This results in around a 15% speedup for filtering by a package name
    wildcard, as used in the fonts category. (MSC)
  * Use QApt::Package::latin1Section() rather than section() when doing a
    PkgSectionFilter-type filter. This speeds up filtering by package section ~30% in the
    Muon Software Center. (MSC)
  * Cache the result of Application::package() during ApplicationBackend initialization
    in the Muon Software Center. (MSC)

- Bugfixes:
  * Fixed certain items in the Muon Software Center from having a wrong name string.
    (Taking the name field of a second group in the .desktop file) (MSC)
  * Use a sane size hint for default window sizes for all Muon frontends
  * Do not show download speed or ETA if we have no good info to show. (MPM)
  * Remove empty categories, and fix the Profiling subcategory showing every
    package available (MSC)
  * Category title text in the Muon Software Center is now translatable.
  * Fix a crash that occurs when the QApt Worker sends a CacheUpdateFinished
    signal while Muon is still starting up. (Bug 276132) (Common)
  * Use QQueue for our installation/removal queue. It is much more robust than QList
    with homebrewn queue behavior using iterators, and solves several crashes.
    (Bug 274225) (MSC)
  * Give the HistoryView a sane default size.

1.1.3:
======
- Bugfixes:
  * Fixed the Muon Software Center displaying Firefox's name as
    "Open a New Window", which is the name field for the Unity launcher group in the
    .desktop file. This was fixed by only taking the name from the first .desktop
    group encountered.
  * Set the event as active while a KSNI is around. This fixes the Muon Notifier
    displaying multiple status icons when events are triggered. (LP: #769482)
  * Merge CategoryDrawer from SystemSettings trunk, bringing in some RTL fixes.
  * Do not search if we are in the middle of a cache reload, like when the
    "Unmark All Changes" button is pressed. This prevents a crash that occurs when
    the proxy model's source model is null during reload. (BKO: #274182)

1.1.2:
======
- Bugfixes:
  * Fixed a serious bug uncovered by a regression in the KDE Solid hardware
    abstraction library in KDE 4.6.2 that prevents actions requiring
    network connectivity from being possible.

1.1.1:
=====
- Bugfixes:
  * Don't show the app launcher dialog for transactions that are only changing
    the addons of an already-installed application.
  * Fix a bug where the Muon Update Notifier would cause kded to accumulate
    zombie processes (Bug 263790)
  * Fix the text of the download view being unreadable with dark themes.
  * Fix a bug where the busy cursor would not go away when a commit was canceled
  * Disable the package view while waiting for a commit to start (Bug 264927)
  * Don't leak our m_screenshotFile when an AppDetailsWidget gets destroyed in
    the Muon Software Center.
  * Fix double exit confirmation for the Muon Package Manager and Update Managers
    (Bug 265283)
  * Don't crash if we get progress updates for transactions that have since
    been removed from the Muon Software Center's transaction queue. (Bug 266173)
  * Fix a bug where an application item in the Muon Software Center could not
    be extended after changing filtering.
- Features:
  * Show the purge button when a package is set to be removed, in case the user
    wants to purge dependencies that had been marked for removal. (Bug 265283)

1.1:
====

- Features:
  * Introducing the Muon Software Center, an easy to use Application-centric
    package manager for the common man.
  * Introducing the "muon-updater" program, an update-centric GUI
  * Added an update notifier
  * The download view has been revamped, now supporting per-item progress,
    as well as displaying the size for each item
  * Add a new "Residual Config" filter to the filters pane. This filter shows packages
    that still have purgeable config files laying around.
  * Add a new "Installed (auto-removable)" filter to the filters pane. This filter shows
    packages that were automatically installed that no longer have any installed
    dependents. (Basically, what apt-get autoremove would show)
  * The Technical Details tab now displays the package's origin
  * Added a progress bar to Muon's statusbar to show Xapian indexing update progress.
  * Improved startup time
  * The contents of the "Installed Files" package tab are now sorted alphabetically
    (BKO: #253751)
  * Implemented sorting the package list by status and by requested changes
  * Canonical-supported packages now have a K/Ubuntu emblem on the icon in the package
    view
  * A "Save Installed Packages List" feature has been added, allowing you to make a list
    of all installed packages that can be read by Muon or Synaptic on another computer.
  * Added an option to configure whether or not a package's recommended packages are
    considered as dependencies.
  * Added an option to configure how often APT autocleans cached package files.
  * Enable/disable the "update" and "apply" buttons based on network availability
  * Automatically reload searches after a rebuild of the search index is triggered

- Optimizations:
  * Avoid a l10n reverse-lookup for package status by using the UserRoles available to 
    us in QStandardItem to store the QApt::Package::State, and emitting this state when 
    passing it to the PackageView
  * Use the new QApt::Backend::areChangesMarked() function for determining whether or not
    actions should be enabled. This avoids constructing a QApt::PackageList as well as
    67,000 calls to QApt::Package::state() in the Backend::markedPackages() function

- Bugfixes:
  * Spacing improvements in the details tabs.
  * Disable the reinstall button for non-reinstallable items, such as non-downloadable
    and/or locally-installed packages. (BKO: #254449)
  * Fix a bug with the new DownloadModel where items from previous downloads would 
    remain if the user cancelled the download
  * Don’t enable the Muon Package Manager’s search widget before the package list is
    populated, so that it is impossible to try to search before the backend has initialized. (And crash)
    In theory this sort of thing could only happen under valgrind-levels of load, but for the
    sake of being proper this is should be fixed.
  * Move libmuon to the top of the link list, so that ld can link it when the –as-needed flag
    is passed to it. (gold is unaffected)
