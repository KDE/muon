  * Fix a bug where the busy cursor would not go away when a commit was canceled

    the Muon Software Center.
  * Fix double exit confirmation for the Muon Package Manager and Update Managers
    (Bug 265283)
  * Don't crash if we get progress updates for transactions that have since
    been removed from the Muon Software Center's transaction queue. (Bug 266173)

1.1:
====

- Features:
  * Introducing the Muon Software Center, an easy to use Application-centric
    package manager for the common man.
  * Introducing the "muon-updater" program, an update-centric GUI
  * Added an update notifier
  * The download view has been revamped, now supporting per-item progress,
    as well as displaying the size for each item
  * Add a new "Residual Config" filter to the filters pane. This filter shows packages
    that still have purgeable config files laying around.
  * Add a new "Installed (auto-removable)" filter to the filters pane. This filter shows
    packages that were automatically installed that no longer have any installed
    dependents. (Basically, what apt-get autoremove would show)
  * The Technical Details tab now displays the package's origin
  * Added a progress bar to Muon's statusbar to show Xapian indexing update progress.
  * Improved startup time
  * The contents of the "Installed Files" package tab are now sorted alphabetically
    (BKO: #253751)
  * Implemented sorting the package list by status and by requested changes
  * Canonical-supported packages now have a K/Ubuntu emblem on the icon in the package
    view
  * A "Save Installed Packages List" feature has been added, allowing you to make a list
    of all installed packages that can be read by Muon or Synaptic on another computer.
  * Added an option to configure whether or not a package's recommended packages are
    considered as dependencies.
  * Added an option to configure how often APT autocleans cached package files.
  * Enable/disable the "update" and "apply" buttons based on network availability
  * Automatically reload searches after a rebuild of the search index is triggered

- Optimizations:
  * Avoid a l10n reverse-lookup for package status by using the UserRoles available to 
    us in QStandardItem to store the QApt::Package::State, and emitting this state when 
    passing it to the PackageView
  * Use the new QApt::Backend::areChangesMarked() function for determining whether or not
    actions should be enabled. This avoids constructing a QApt::PackageList as well as
    67,000 calls to QApt::Package::state() in the Backend::markedPackages() function

- Bugfixes:
  * Spacing improvements in the details tabs.
  * Disable the reinstall button for non-reinstallable items, such as non-downloadable
    and/or locally-installed packages. (BKO: #254449)
  * Fix a bug with the new DownloadModel where items from previous downloads would 
    remain if the user cancelled the download
  * Don’t enable the Muon Package Manager’s search widget before the package list is
    populated, so that it is impossible to try to search before the backend has initialized. (And crash)
    In theory this sort of thing could only happen under valgrind-levels of load, but for the
    sake of being proper this is should be fixed.
  * Move libmuon to the top of the link list, so that ld can link it when the –as-needed flag
    is passed to it. (gold is unaffected)
